^\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ Tor\[[[:digit:]]+\]: Your network connection speed appears to have changed. Resetting timeout to [[:digit:]]+s after [[:digit:]]+ timeouts and [[:digit:]]+ buildtimes.$
^\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ Tor\[[[:digit:]]+\]: We now have enough directory information to build circuits.$
^\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ Tor\[[[:digit:]]+\]: I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We're missing descriptors for [/[:digit:]]+ of our primary entry guards \(total microdescriptors: [/[:digit:]]+\).$
^\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ Tor\[[[:digit:]]+\]: Our directory information is no longer up-to-date enough to build circuits: We're missing descriptors for [/[:digit:]]+ of our primary entry guards \(total microdescriptors: [/[:digit:]]+\).$
^\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ Tor\[[[:digit:]]+\]:  Your Guard grocock ([\$[:alnum:]]+) is failing a very large amount of circuits. Most likely this means the Tor network is overloaded, but it could also mean an attack against you or potentially the guard itself. Success counts are [/[:digit:]]+. Use counts are [/[:digit:]]+. [[:digit:]]+ circuits completed, [[:digit:]]+ were unusable, [[:digit:]]+ collapsed, and [[:digit:]]+ timed out. For reference, your timeout cutoff is [[:digit:]]+ seconds.$
^\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ Tor\[[[:digit:]]+\]: Average packaged cell fullness: [.[:digit:]]+\%. TLS write overhead: [.[:digit:]]+\%$
